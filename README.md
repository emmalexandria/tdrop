`tdrop` is a Rust crate which provides a wide array of functionality for non-interactive terminal applications. 
This includes a widget rendering system (with support for async widgets e.g. progressbars), flex layouts, and terminal styling. 
It presumes limited width and unlimited height, and provides built-in progressbars, text inputs, and other widgets.
